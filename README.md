# VitalCore

Core Features for the App
Data Modeling

Create tables in MySQL for "Cells," "Genes," or "Life Factors."
Each table represents an aspect of "life" or "aging" (e.g., lifespan, repair rate, mutation rate).
Simulations

Add a feature where users can run hypothetical "treatments."
Example: "Increase repair rate by 10% for all cellsâ€”what happens to lifespan?"
Interactive Dashboard

Build a React frontend to display graphs and tables.
Use D3.js or Chart.js to visualize things like lifespan changes, population effects, or aging trends.
API Integration

Create a GraphQL API to let users query simulations or upload their own "life factor" data.
Example: "What if we modify this gene's activity level?"
Real-Time Updates

Use WebSockets for live updates (e.g., real-time simulation progress).
Example: Show graphs changing as the simulation runs.
Scalable Infrastructure

Deploy the app using Kubernetes to handle scaling (e.g., if users run many simulations).
